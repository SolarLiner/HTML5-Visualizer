# HTML5-Visualizer
HTML5 basic visualizer - Oscilloscope and Spectrum | [Demo](http://solarliner.github.io/HTML5-Visualizer/)

## What is it?
It's an HTML5 Web Audio experiment using only CSS and JavaScript. It started as a "how to display a spectrometer" to "how to display it in the log scale" to "make something out of this.
I am now in the process of adding some random features, because the question is not "why?" but "why not?".

## What's the purpose then?
Still thinking that one, please allow me some time ...

## Can i use it ?
YES. At least I'll have the feeling I did something useful, for once. Just credit me somewhere :)
